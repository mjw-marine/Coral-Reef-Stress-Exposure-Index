# Coral-Reef-Stress-Exposure-Index
Google Earth Engine code for Coral Reef Stress Exposure Index

Part of a PhD chapter to investigate if remotely sensed environmental data from Google Earth Engine can be used to investigate stress on coral reef systems at a global scale.

Based on a review of the literature, 11 environmental variables, known to cause stress in coral reef ecosystems, were identified, that could be estimated from EO data and were available in GEE. Using fuzzy logic (discontinuous functions) and thresholds obtained from the literature, coral exposure to each of these variables was quantified. Each variable was given a stress exposure score between 0 and 1, with a final Coral Reef Stress Exposure Index (CRSEI) calculated for each reef system. 

Code for the CRSEI provided, as well as a link to it in Google Earth Engine.

Code for the Automated Shallow Water Bathymetry for Global Coral Reef Regions (CRSEI_ASWB) data devised from Li et al. (2021) https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081469 is also provided.

Link to publication will be added when publication occurs.
